      <description>In theory, it would be nice to have everything automated. In reality, it might be the case that for some reasons you have to run and manually verify test results.
There can be a number of ways for running manual Cucumber tests, for Ruby there&amp;rsquo;s even whole CukeHub to run and organize manual tests, but my research yielded no results on how to do manual testing in Java.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a writing my Bachelor thesis at TU Berlin while working as a software engineer at Swedbank Latvia.
Would like to think of myself that I take every task on my work seriously and prefer difficult assignments, requiring root cause analysis and deep system understanding to a quick &amp;ldquo;move that button and get a praise for it&amp;rdquo; tasks, but it&amp;rsquo;s better to ask my colleagues about it. Have interest in Quality Assurance and Machine Learning, on my current work I have to deal with lots of business-logic.</description>
