      <title>Running manual Cucumber tests in Java</title>

      <description>In theory, it would be nice to have everything automated. In reality, it might be the case that for some reasons you have to run and manually verify test results.
There can be a number of ways for running manual Cucumber tests, for Ruby there&amp;rsquo;s even whole CukeHub to run and organize manual tests, but my research yielded no results on how to do manual testing in Java.
So, let&amp;rsquo;s implement it our self.</description>

      <description>Have a Bachelor degree from TU Berlin, now working as a software engineer and scrum master at Swedbank Latvia.
I would like to think of myself that I take every task on my work seriously and prefer difficult assignments, requiring root cause analysis and deep system understanding to a quick &amp;ldquo;move that button and get praise for it&amp;rdquo; tasks, but it&amp;rsquo;s better to ask my colleagues about it. Have an interest in Quality Assurance and Machine Learning, on my current work I have to deal with lots of domain-logic heavy applications.</description>

      <description>Nordic Testing Days 2019 Full-day tutorial: Efficient Selenium Infrastructure with Selenoid.
The most insightful tutorial for me. Was lead by a really cool specialist, who works daily with Highload in testing infrastructure. Unfortunately, the tutorial went slowly and didn&amp;rsquo;t cover all the topics presenter hoped to cover, because of the low preparation level from participants.
Honorable mentions:
Resilience Testing: Let the chaos begin! Presenters went over basics of Gattling and introduced a Chaos Monkey.</description>
