      <description>This is a stub, on a Russian version of this blog you may read a blog post in which I analyze the following certifications: 1Z0-808 1Z0-819 1Z0-909 1Z0-071 RHCSA  If you are interested in what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about those certifications and their requirements - feel free to switch to the Russian version of this site. If you are interested in learning more about said certifications - then I can only advise you to follow the links and read info from the original sources.</description>

There can be a number of ways for running manual Cucumber tests, for Ruby there&amp;rsquo;s even whole CukeHub to run and organize manual tests, but my research yielded no results on how to do manual testing in Java.
So, let&amp;rsquo;s implement it our self.</description>
