    <p>Hi! I'm Anton, a student and a half-time software developer and this is my very own web page.</p>
    <p align="justify">It is meant to be my CV, plus I'm going to add here links to my works and projects.
        Sorry for non-existing design, this is actually a third version of a site. At first I wanted to create some
        monstrosity, combining and showing off all of the frameworks I know,
        and including some custom-made blog, forum, video player and a couple of games, just to show-off.
        Then I got wise, ald wrote just the text you see below.
        I hope, it will be informational enough, but you may also
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anton-bardishev-05a3b9a5">contact me</a> at any time.
