      <description>Intro Before going to DevTernity 2021 I had no expectations of what might be in there. It was just another conference that was forwarded to me by my manager, and I was just bored enough to decide to sign up for it. I haven&amp;rsquo;t checked the backgrounds of the presenters and wasn&amp;rsquo;t even aware that Uncle Bob himself will give a talk there.
During the conference, I was amazed by the technical level of presenters and the potential usefulness of the reports.</description>
