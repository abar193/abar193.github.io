Overview of big data storage tech. Pros-, Cons-, how to use. By Maksim Stacenko
Topics:
 Describing technologies, highlighting how to save date engineer time by choosing not the most popular solutions Share experience from PoC works on big data Saving on hardware
 Your data storage is a product: do you store test data only, do you use it in production, does it working 24/7 (especially with the new remote work approach), do you remember the legal consequences of neglecting data safety and consistency?</description>

      <description>Hidden pearls for high-performance-persistence in Java Presented by Sven Ruppert - DevSecOps from JFrog.
Presentation was pre-recorder, but the questions were live.
Why and what: Inside of JVM, for different areas - from embedded, to terabyte-big document storage systems, but scaling and tuning ways of storing data.
You can&amp;rsquo;t get rid of the persistence layer, but there are three solutions as the beginning of making optimization.
JOOQ: a tool for mapping SQL to Java DSL - SQL style, generated from the DB schema.</description>

      <description>In theory, it would be nice to have everything automated. In reality, it might be the case that for some reasons you have to run and manually verify test results.
There can be a number of ways for running manual Cucumber tests, for Ruby there&amp;rsquo;s even whole CukeHub to run and organize manual tests, but my research yielded no results on how to do manual testing in Java.
So, let&amp;rsquo;s implement it our self.</description>
