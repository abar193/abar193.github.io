      <description>Intro I have attended a DevOps Conference in Berlin and here I will try to summarize my experience and outtakes from it.
This hybrid conference was located &amp;ndash; physically &amp;ndash; in the heart of Berlin, at Martim Hotel near Friedrichstra√üe S-Bahn station. That location was very well known to me, because it was a changing station from when I went from my university to my work. So, visiting it again after several years was pleasant and nostalgic, and I&amp;rsquo;m, glad that not much has changed there - not for the worst, at least.</description>
