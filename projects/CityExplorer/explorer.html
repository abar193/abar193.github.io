                <h3>General</h3>
                In the past I have been experimenting with all sorts of programming, from game engineering to
                mobile apps development. Now it looks like I'm focused on Web development. I'd like to say I prefer
                developing backend side, bringing toether all those components hidden from user's sight, rather than finding out
                why is "that window" not working properly in "those browser" but in the end I'm ready to do whatever is
                necessary to bring best possible product to the user.
