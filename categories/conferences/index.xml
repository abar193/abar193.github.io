      <description>Intro Before going to DevTernity 2021 I had no expectations of what might be in there. It was just another conference that was forwarded to me by my manager, and I was just bored enough to decide to sign up for it. I haven&amp;rsquo;t checked the backgrounds of the presenters and wasn&amp;rsquo;t even aware that Uncle Bob himself will give a talk there.
During the conference, I was amazed by the technical level of presenters and the potential usefulness of the reports.</description>

      <description>My synopsis + English translation for IT_One Meet Up - a free online meetup for Java and Big Data.
Overview of big data storage tech. Pros-, Cons-, how to use. By Maksim Stacenko
Topics:
 Describing technologies, highlighting how to save date engineer time by choosing not the most popular solutions Share experience from PoC works on big data Saving on hardware
 Your data storage is a product: do you store test data only, do you use it in production, does it working 24/7 (especially with the new remote work approach), do you remember the legal consequences of neglecting data safety and consistency?</description>

      <description>Hidden pearls for high-performance-persistence in Java Presented by Sven Ruppert - DevSecOps from JFrog.
Presentation was pre-recorder, but the questions were live.
Why and what: Inside of JVM, for different areas - from embedded, to terabyte-big document storage systems, but scaling and tuning ways of storing data.
You can&amp;rsquo;t get rid of the persistence layer, but there are three solutions as the beginning of making optimization.
JOOQ: a tool for mapping SQL to Java DSL - SQL style, generated from the DB schema.</description>

      <description>Full-day tutorial Efficient Selenium Infrastructure with Selenoid.
The most insightful tutorial for me. Was lead by a really cool specialist, who works daily with Highload in testing infrastructure. Unfortunately, the tutorial went slowly and didn&amp;rsquo;t cover all the topics presenter hoped to cover, because of the low preparation level from participants.
Honorable mentions: Resilience Testing: Let the chaos begin! Presenters went over basics of Gattling and introduced a Chaos Monkey. Once again, the audience wasn&amp;rsquo;t prepared for it, and we were stuck in the first step with setting up VMs and launching Gatling scenarios.</description>
